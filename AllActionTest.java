/**
   In this file, you are required to write code for your part Part 3. 
   The reason for this class is to demonstrate the Action class and subclasses.
   You must fill an array of action objects (hint: check the sample output file provided for you) with
   different action activities. A user of this system should be able to input a date of their choice and
   retrieve an output of all activities that would occur on that date.
   You should reuse the Action class and RegularAction classes from Part I of your solution
   and then the OccasionalAction and RareAction classes from your Part 2.
